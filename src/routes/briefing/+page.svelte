        EDDIE: what's going to happen on this page is that you're going to explain to the
        participant what they're supposed to do when they are given an editor. Explain the scenario
        (they are fixing some broken code) and that they need to fix it. They can rerun the code to
        see if they fixed anything. The user can submit as soon as they are able to fix the issue
        with the code. They can pass after a time limit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Politely ask the participant to NOT use external help (google, stackoverflow, chatgpt, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>EDDIE: put pictures. Make it BLATENTLY OBVIOUS what they're supposed to do.</p>
    <p>EDDIE: maybe make a YouTube video?</p>
