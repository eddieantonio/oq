        "content": "The error message is indicating that you're trying to modify the value of the argument `n` inside the `fibonacci` function, which is not allowed in Rust. In Rust, function parameters are immutable by default. This means that once a value is bound to a variable, you can't change that value.\n\nTo fix this, you need to create a mutable copy of `n` inside the function and then modify that copy. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```rust\nfn fibonacci(mut n: u64) -> u64 {\n    let mut now = 0;\n    let mut next = 1;\n    while n > 0 {\n        let temp = now + next;\n        now = next;\n        next = temp;\n        n = n - 1;\n    }\n\n    now\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"the 7th fibonacci number is {}\", fibonacci(7));\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, `n` is declared as mutable (`mut n: u64`) in the function parameter list, which allows it to be modified within the function."
