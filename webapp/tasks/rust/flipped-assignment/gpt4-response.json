        "content": "The error is caused because you are trying to assign the result of the expression `a + b` to `c` in an incorrect way. In Rust, the left-hand side of an assignment operation should be a mutable variable that will store the result of the operation. However, in your code, `a + b` is on the left-hand side, which is not a valid target for assignment.\n\nTo fix this problem, you should swap `a + b` and `c` in the assignment operation. Also, you need to declare `c` as mutable because you are changing its value after initialization. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let a = 10;\n    let b = 20;\n    let mut c;\n\n    c = a + b;\n\n    println!(\"the sum is {}\", c);\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, `c` is declared as mutable with `let mut c;`, and then the sum of `a` and `b` is correctly assigned to `c` with `c = a + b;`."
