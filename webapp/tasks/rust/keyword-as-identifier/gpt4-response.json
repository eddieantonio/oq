        "content": "The error is caused because `ref` is a reserved keyword in Rust. It's used in pattern matching to create a reference to a value. In your code, you're trying to use `ref` as a variable name, which is not allowed.\n\nTo fix the problem, you should rename the `ref` variable to something else. Here's a corrected version of your code:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let non_ref = 421.0;\n    let reference = 324.0; // renamed 'ref' to 'reference'\n\n    let ratio = reference / non_ref;\n\n    println!(\"The percentage of refs to non-refs is {}.\", 100.0 * ratio);\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, `ref` has been renamed to `reference`, which is not a reserved keyword and can be used as a variable name."
