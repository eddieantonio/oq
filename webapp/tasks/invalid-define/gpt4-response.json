        "content": "The error is caused because the `#const` directive is not a valid preprocessing directive in C. The preprocessor directives in C start with a `#` symbol, such as `#include`, `#define`, etc. However, `#const` is not one of them.\n\nTo define constants in C, you should use the `#define` directive or the `const` keyword. The `#define` directive is a preprocessor directive which is used to define symbolic constants, while the `const` keyword is used to declare variables whose value cannot be changed after initialization.\n\nHere's how you can fix the problem:\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define PI 3.141592653589793\n\nfloat area(float radius) {\n    return PI * radius * radius;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    printf(\"The area of the circle is: %.1f\\n\", area(1.128375));\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, `#define PI 3.141592653589793` is used instead of `#const pi 3.141592653589793`. This defines `PI` as a symbolic constant that can be used throughout the code."
