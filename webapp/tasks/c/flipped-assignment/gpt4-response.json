        "content": "The error message \"lvalue required as left operand of assignment\" is indicating that the left side of the assignment operator (=) needs to be a variable (or more technically, an \"lvalue\" - a location that can hold a value). \n\nIn your code, you have `a + b = c;` which is incorrect because `a + b` is not a variable, it's an expression. The result of `a + b` cannot hold a value. \n\nTo fix this, you should assign the result of `a + b` to the variable `c`. This can be done by changing `a + b = c;` to `c = a + b;`. \n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]){\n\n    int a = 10;\n    int b = 20;\n    int c = 0;\n\n    c = a + b;\n\n    printf(\"the sum is %d.\\n\", c);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nNow, the sum of `a` and `b` is correctly stored in `c`, and the program will print out the sum as expected."
