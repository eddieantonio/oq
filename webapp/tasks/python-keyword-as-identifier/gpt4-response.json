        "content": "The error message is indicating that the compiler expected a '{' before the '=' token. However, this error message is misleading because the actual problem lies in the use of the keyword \"union\". \n\nIn C programming, \"union\" is a reserved keyword. It's used to declare union types, which are special data types that allow storing different types of data in the same memory location. You can't use \"union\" as a variable name, which is what you're trying to do in your code.\n\nTo fix the problem, you should rename the variable \"union\" to something else that isn't a reserved keyword. Here's a corrected version of your code:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]){\n\n   int nonUnion = 421;\n   int unionWorkers = 324;  // renamed \"union\" to \"unionWorkers\"\n   float ratio;\n\n   ratio = (float)unionWorkers / (float)nonUnion;\n\n   printf(\"The percentage of union workers is %f.\\n\", 100 * ratio);\n\n   return 0;\n}\n```\n\nNow, the code should compile and run without errors."
