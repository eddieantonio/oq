**Error**: `union` is a keyword and cannot be used as variable name.

```
   6 |    int union = 324;
              ~~~~~ using keyword as a variable name
```


**Help**: either choose a different name for this variable or append an
underscore to the end of the keyword to make it a valid name.

```
   6 |    int union_ = 324;
                   + add underscore to make a valid name
```
