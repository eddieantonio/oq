        "content": "The error in the code is due to the incorrect use of the `If` statement. In Python, the correct keyword for a conditional statement is `if`, not `If`. Python is case-sensitive, so `If` is not recognized as a valid keyword, leading to a `SyntaxError`.\n\nTo fix the problem, you should replace `If` with `if`. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```python\nbirth_year = int(input(\"What year were you born?\"))\ncurrent_year = 2024\n\nage = current_year - birth_year\n\nif age > 30:  # Use 'if' instead of 'If'\n    print(\"You're old\")\n```\n\nWith this change, the code will run without syntax errors. The `if` statement will correctly check if the `age` is greater than 30 and print \"You're old\" if the condition is true.",
