        "content": "The error is caused because you're trying to use the `append` method on a tuple. In Python, tuples are immutable, which means they can't be changed after they're created. This is why the `append` method, which tries to add an element to the tuple, is causing an error.\n\nTo fix this problem, you can change `sequence` to be a list instead of a tuple. Lists in Python are mutable, so you can add elements to them after they're created. Here's how you can fix your code:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    sequence = []  # Change this line\n    now = 0\n    next = 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        temp = now + next\n        now = next\n        next = temp\n        sequence.append(now)\n    return sequence\n\nprint(\"the first 7 fibonacci numbers are\", fibonacci(7))\n```\n\nNow, `sequence` is a list, and you can use the `append` method to add elements to it. This will generate the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence."
