        "content": "The error is caused because you are trying to assign the value of variable 'c' to the expression 'a + b'. In Python, the '=' operator is used for assignment, meaning it sets the value of a variable. However, 'a + b' is not a variable, it's an expression, so you can't assign a value to it.\n\nTo fix the problem, you should swap 'a + b' and 'c' in the equation so that the sum of 'a' and 'b' is assigned to 'c'. Here's how you can correct the code:\n\n```\na = 10\nb = 20\n\nc = a + b\n\nprint(\"the sum is\", c)\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, 'c' is assigned the value of 'a + b', which is the sum of 'a' and 'b'. Then, the sum is printed out."
