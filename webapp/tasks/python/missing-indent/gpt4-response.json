        "content": "The error is caused by incorrect indentation. In Python, the body of a function is defined by its indentation. All the statements that belong to the function need to be indented by the same amount from the start of the function definition.\n\nIn your code, the statements inside the function `area()` are not indented, so Python doesn't recognize them as part of the function. This is why you're getting an `IndentationError`.\n\nTo fix the problem, you need to indent the statements inside the function. Here's how your corrected code should look:\n\n```python\ndef area():\n    length = 12.1\n    width = 23.2\n    return length * width\n\nprint(\"the area is\", area())\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, the statements `length = 12.1`, `width = 23.2`, and `return length * width` are indented by four spaces, indicating that they are part of the function `area()`."
