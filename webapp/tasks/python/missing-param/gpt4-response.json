        "content": "The error is occurring because the function `convert()` is defined without any parameters, but when it's called in the `print` statement, it's given one argument (68.0). \n\nThe function `convert()` is also trying to use a variable `fahrenheit` which is not defined anywhere in the code. This would cause a NameError if the TypeError was not occurring first.\n\nTo fix the problem, you need to modify the function definition to accept a parameter, which will be the Fahrenheit temperature to convert. You can then use this parameter in the conversion calculation. Here's how you can fix it:\n\n```python\ndef convert(fahrenheit):\n    return (fahrenheit - 32.0) / 1.8\n\nprint(68.0, \"fahrenheit is\", convert(68.0), \"celsius\")\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, `convert(fahrenheit)` is defined with `fahrenheit` as a parameter. When you call `convert(68.0)`, the number 68.0 is passed into the function and used in the conversion calculation."
