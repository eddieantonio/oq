**Error**: `import` is a reserved word and cannot be used as variable name.

```python
   2 | import = 324
     | ~~~~~~ using reserved word as a variable name
```

**Help**: either choose a different name for this variable or append an
underscore to the end of the keyword to make it a valid name.

```python
   2 | import_ = 324
     |       + add underscore to make a valid name
```
