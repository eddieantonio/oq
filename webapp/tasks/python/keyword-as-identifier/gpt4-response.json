Reserved keywords are terms that have special meaning in Python and cannot be used as variable names. In this case, \"import\" is used to include external modules or libraries in your code, and \"export\" is not a keyword in Python but it's a keyword in Unix/Linux shell scripting.\n\nTo fix the problem, you can simply rename the variables to something that is not a reserved keyword. Here's a corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nexports = 421\nimports = 324\nratio = exports / imports\n\nprint(\"The percentage of exports to imports is\", 100 * ratio)\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, \"exports\" and \"imports\" are used instead of \"export\" and \"import\", which are valid variable names and do not conflict with any reserved keywords."
