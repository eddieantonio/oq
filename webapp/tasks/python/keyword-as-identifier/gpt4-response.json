        "content": "The error in the code occurs because the word `import` is a reserved keyword in Python. Reserved keywords have special meanings and are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language. You cannot use them as variable names.\n\nIn this code, the line `import = 324` attempts to assign the value `324` to a variable named `import`, which is not allowed because `import` is a reserved keyword used for importing modules.\n\nTo fix this problem, you need to choose a different name for the variable. For example, you could rename the variable to `imports` or `import_value`. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nexport = 421\nimports = 324  # Changed from 'import' to 'imports'\nratio = export / imports\n\nprint(\"The percentage of exports to imports is\", 100 * ratio)\n```\n\nBy changing the variable name from `import` to `imports`, the code will run without a syntax error, and it will correctly calculate and print the percentage of exports to imports.",
