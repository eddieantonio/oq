The `#include` directive is used to include the contents of any other file in the program at the time of preprocessing.\n\nThe corrected code should be:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n   printf(\"Hello, world!\\n\");\n   return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, `#include <stdio.h>` is used to include the standard input/output library in C. This library is necessary for the `printf` function used in the program. Also, it's a good practice to return a value from the `main` function, typically `return 0;` is used to indicate that the program has run successfully."
