        "content": "The error message you're seeing is because you're trying to modify the value of the parameter 'n' inside your function. In C, function parameters are read-only, meaning you can't change their values within the function.\n\nThe 'n' parameter is passed as a constant integer to the fibonacci function. The keyword 'const' is used to make variables read-only after initialization. This means that once a value is assigned to a 'const' variable, you can't change it. In your code, you're trying to decrement the value of 'n' with 'n = n - 1', which is not allowed because 'n' is a 'const' variable.\n\nTo fix this problem, you can create a new variable inside your function, assign 'n' to it, and then modify that new variable instead of 'n'. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint fibonacci(int n) {\n    int now = 0, next = 1;\n    int temp;\n    int i = n;\n    while (i > 0){\n        temp = now + next;\n        now = next;\n        next = temp;\n        i = i - 1;\n    }\n    return now;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    printf(\"the 7th fibonacci number is %d\\n\", fibonacci(7));\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, I've created a new variable 'i' and assigned 'n' to it. Then, I've replaced 'n' with 'i' in the while loop. Now, the function modifies 'i' instead of 'n', and the code will compile and run without errors."
