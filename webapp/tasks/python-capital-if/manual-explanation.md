**Error**: mistake detected here on line 2

**Note**: Interpreting `If` as a variable name

```
  10 |         If (input == "s3cr37"): print("You are in!")
     |         -- `If` is interpreted as variable/function/class name 
```

**Help**: convert to lowercase if you meant to write an `if` statement.

```
  10 |         if (input == "s3cr37"): print("You are in!")
     |         ++ change to `if`
```
