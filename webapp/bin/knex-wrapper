# Invokes Knex correctly, depending on the environment.
#
# The problem that I created for myself is that Knex is configured through a file that is a:
#
#  - a) ESM module
#  - b) TypeScript file
#
# The correct invocation of Knex when you have a TypeScript compiler around is:
#
# $ env NODE_OPTIONS=--loader ts-node/esm ./node_modules/.bin/knex --knexfile knexfile.ts
#
# However, in production, the TypeScript compiler is not available, so the
# Dockerfile helpfully compiles this into a CommonJS module (note: **no longer**
# ESM!) Since the webapp's package.json has "type": "module", the Knexfile MUST
# be a file with a .cjs extension.  Knex does not automatically pick up on the
# .cjs extension, annoyingly.
#
# So this is how you have to invoke Knex in production:
#
# $ ./node_modules/.bin/knex --knexfile knexfile.cjs
#
# This script attempts to solve this problem by detecting whether ts-node is installed,
# and using knexfile.ts with the ts-node/esm loader. Otherwise, we assume we are production
# and using knexfile.cjs.

if [ -d ./node_modules/ts-node ]; then
    exec env NODE_OPTIONS='--loader ts-node/esm' ./node_modules/.bin/knex "$@"
else
    # Ensure that knexfile.cjs exists
    if [ ! -f knexfile.cjs ]; then
        echo "error: knexfile.cjs does not exist and neither does ts-node. What gives?" >&2
        exit 1
    fi

    exec ./node_modules/.bin/knex --knexfile knexfile.cjs "$@"
fi
